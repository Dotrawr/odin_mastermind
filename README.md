## Mastermind

This repo contains my implementation of the Mastermind as described in The Odin Project.

The documentation says to: 

  ```Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.```
  
and then to refactor the code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
